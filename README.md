# Exploring the genetic adaptations of hematophagous Triatominae (Hemiptera: Reduviidae)
## Veronica Tyts & Sarah Schroeder
### Introduction
Hi! Welcome to the git hub repository for our gen220 project. Within this repository you will find all of the scripts we used to identify genetic differences between hematophagous and predatory reduviids, annotate those genes, and create our figures.
